    We’ve stayed private and we have never taken other people’s money. Neither will change. This keeps us independent and beholden to only the customer, permitting a long term view to naturally unfold. We are private, but far from small.

      With nearly 26 years in the industry, our style of unconventional thinking seems to have paid off. Softpal is committed to spending your money wisely. Our investment in people is a critical part of our R&D edge.

      <img src="ab5.jpg" width = 730px; height= 200px; class="mr-3" alt="..."></center>
  <div class="media-body">
    <p>Over the years, we've crafted dozens of products with equal fervor. Now they are even available under one single integrated suite, Softpal One that can put a business completely on the cloud. Unlike our competitors, who occasionally wake up to discover gaping product holes that they must now fill urgently with acquisitions to reassure their shareholders, we craft our portfolio with patience and anticipation.<br><br>
    Our approach is taken from the realization that the vast majority of acquisitions fail, and it’s the customer that pays the price. Many of our products were developed to meet our own needs—for Softpal itself runs entirely on Softpal. This means our software often must fail us, before it can fail you.

    We focused on our customers' market facing business processes such as research, product development, marketing, sales and customer service. Our duty is to delight our customers by providing excellence in IT services, value and results. We have received wide range of awards and other recognition for our efforts.

    Softpal is committed to spending your money wisely. We put more efforts in product development and customer support than in sales and marketing. It always struck us as contradictory to charge the customer extra for the privilege of marketing back to them. By keeping our cost of attracting customers low, we keep our prices affordable and pass the savings onto our users.
<br><br>

We’re moderate in our sales approach, so we don't drive our people to push you. You won’t find us difficult to endlessly up sell you, or buying your loyalty through multi-year contracts. And with development that regularly outstrips our competitors; we know that this model works.
